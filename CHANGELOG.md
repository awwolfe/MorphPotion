<a href="https://youtu.be/4BrvdKbVAHo"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/4BrvdKbVAHo/0.jpg"></a> 

* Added Public API (technical)
    * `mchorse.metamorph.api.MorphAPI` class provides API static methods
    * `IMorphProvider` – for entities that want to be rendered
    * `IHandProvider` – for `ModelBase`s who want to provide `ModelRenderer`s for first-person hand rendering

        * `MorphEvent` – when player is about to morph or to demorph
        * `AcquireMorphEvent` – when player is about to acquire a morph
        * `MorphActionEvent` – when player is about to use morph's action
    * `IMorphFactory` – for adding and registering morphs, abilities, attacks and actions.
* Added support for third-party living base mobs (Entities which derive from `EntityLivingBase` and have `RenderLivingBase&lt;?&gt;` renderers)
* Added morphs user configuration (`morphs.json` in config folder)

## Metamorph 1.0.2

Small patch update that makes this mod work on Forge modded server (I thought it was working, but apparently I forgot to test it out).

Besides that morph's names were changed a little bit and Iron Golem's attack `knockback` was fixed.

* Changed the way how morph's names are displayed
* Fixed server crashes and errors (works on server, although there might be bugs)
* Fixed Iron Golem's `knockback` attack in multiplayer (previously it didn't worked)

## Metamorph 1.0.1

First patch of Metamorph mod.

This patch doesn't really add stuff, rather it improves `1.0` release based on some of my thoughts and people's input from comments on PMC, PM, mails and mod reviews.

This patch adds few configuration options, improves GUIs, fixes some bugs and improves some morphs and rendering of the hand (thanks to [Blockbuster's mod](https://github.com/mchorse/blockbuster/) hands code).

* Added acquiring **morph** overlay (replaced chat messages).
* Improved first-person hand rendering (will work even with shaders).
* Improved **Creative Morphs Menu**:

        * Key `arrow-up`: scroll up a little bit
        * Key `arrow-down`: scroll down a little bit
        * Key `arrow-left`: scroll to top
        * Key `arrow-right`: scroll to bottom
    * Added dragable scroll bar
    * Fixed crash when morphing with no morph selected
* Improved **Survival Morph Menu**:
    * Added **demorph** key. There's no default key, so you'll have to set it up.
    * If `[` or `]` pressed with `shift` modifier, one morph will be skipped.
    * If `[` or `]` pressed with `alt` modifier, selection will go in the beginning or the end.
    * Press `[` or `]` will highlight menu even if cursor hasn't moved.
    * When pressing `enter` (apply morph), the **Survival Morph Menu** will disappear.
* Improved **morphs**:
    * Added `hostile` ability, to most of hostile **morphs** and for some neutral and animal **morphs**, making morphed players not hostile to hostile mobs.
    * Added `speed` property. Now some of the **morphs** (`Ozelot`, `EntityHorse` and `Rabbit)` run faster or (`VillagerGolem`) run slower.
    * Added `night_vision` ability to `Guardian`.
    * Increased range and accuracy of `potions` action (`Witch` morph, basically).
    * When a player morphs or pick ups a morph, popping sound effect is played
* Sound effects for `teleport` action was added
